# COVID-19 Analysis
This is my interpretation of the COVID19 data. <br>
The whole project will take up a span of 9 weeks. In this duration i will attempt to develop and optimize a deliverable software project. [Reference materials will be listed at the very bottom.](#Sources)

## Objectives

## Environment 
I am running on Ubuntu 19.10(x86_64) with Jupyter Lab(Jupyter notebook would suffice for testing the code) with python 3.7.4. The required packages will be listed along the code in **requirements.txt**(provided later). I will attempt to document all the installation steps for specific packages if necessary.
