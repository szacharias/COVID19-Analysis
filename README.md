# COVID-19 Analysis
This is my interpretation of the COVID19 data. <br>
The whole project will take up a span of 9 weeks. In this duration i will attempt to develop and optimize a deliverable software project. [Reference materials will be listed at the very bottom.](#Sources)

## Goal


## Objectives

## Environment and Build
I am running on Ubuntu 19.10(x86_64) with Jupyter Lab(Jupyter notebook would suffice for testing the code) with python 3.7.4. Further inspections can be seen [here!](https://github.com/szacharias/COVID19-Analysis/blob/master/Code/Environment.ipynb) <br>
To start jupyter notebook/lab, input
```
jupyter notebook
jupyter lab
```
and navigate to [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). Port 8888 by default.
<br>
The required packages will be listed along the code in _requirements_ (provided later).
Run the following commands for the first time
```
pip install -r ./code/requirements.txt
```
 <br>
